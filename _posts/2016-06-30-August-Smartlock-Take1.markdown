Today I installed the August Smart Lock for HomeKit enabled control over the dead bolt
on my front door. Installing the August Smart Lock itself was very simple - however, there
were two major challenges to overcome:

* My front door wasn't drilled for a deadbolt
* The deadbolt I bought is incompatible with the August Smart Lock

### Step 1: Drill for a New Deadbolt
This part was actually surprisingly straight forward ... however, again there was a challenge:
I haven't moved my tools or equipment yet. My drill, in particular, is still safe and sound in my
toolchest back in NY. That made this the perfect opportunity to pick up a brand new <a href="http://www.dewalt.com/products/power-tools/drills/drills-and-hammer-drills/20v-max-lithium-ion-premium-3speed-hammerdrill-tool-only/dcd985b">Dewalt 20V Max Hammer Drill</a>.

Of course, since this is a Smart Home project, I opted to get the smart battery pack, with Dewalt Tool Connect support! Dewalt Tool Connect gives me visibility to battery pack levels on my phone, and alerts when they need recharging. I can also enable/disable the pack from my iOS devices.

In any case, a 2 1/8" hole saw and a 1" spade bit made very quick work of the door.

### Step 2: Replace the Deadbolt
I had purchased a Kwikset Downtown deadbolt for this project, since I really liked the style. Unfortunately the deadbolt isn't compatible the August Smart Lock.

The Smart Lock will work with nearly any deadbolt where the torque arm extends from the outside portion of the lock through the center of the latch. However, these low profile locks have a torque arm which extends _below_ the latch and connects to a rotating back plate on the inside. This backplate in turn transfers the motion of the lock to a second arm, which extends from the _inside_ of the lock through the center of the latch.

For now, I've temporarily replaced the deadbolt with a Kwikset 980 standard deadbolt. Once the deadbolt was installed, setting up the August Smart Lock was quick and painless.

### Step 3: "Siri, unlock the front door"
Once the app is installed and calibrated, operating it is as simple as saying: "Siri, lock the front door." That tiny little robot I've never talked to takes care of the rest, with just the tiniest hint of sass.

### Conclusion
I really like the Kwikset low profile style lock and matching door handle ... so I've decided that I'm going to reinstall those on my front door, and move the keyless entry to exterior door that leads to the garage instead.

The garage entrance lends itself much better to running the wiring I need for the HES8000 electric strike, and will likely be the door I use 90% of the time anyway. Once I have the garage doors enabled for MyQ, I'll still have full keyless entry to the home, and all the same ability to grant access to guests, baby sitters, or other visitors to the home.

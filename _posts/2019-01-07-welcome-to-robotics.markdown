Welcome to the ZBL Robotics and Home Automation Blog... a hobby project and research arm of ZBL Services, Inc. This blog will serve as a place where I'll keep my notes and designs for projects related to robotics (stay tuned for a rubik's cube solver!) and home automation / smart home devices. I’m fascinated by IoT and its implications for the connected home, automation, security, and convenience. 

My smart home is currently based on the Apple HomeKit ecosystem, and includes most lights in the house, thermostats, smoke and CO2 alarms, deadbolts, door & window sensors, and garage door openers. I’m currently building out an infrastructure in the house to host Homebridge, for integrating non-homekit native devices, a VPN (more on this in another post), and data gathering and analysis.

I’ll post here intermittently as I complete various bits and pieces. This is a side project prioritized behind family, work, and regular home maintenance... so updates may be infrequent. My hope is that you’ll check back often, and find useful information to help you along your way towards building your own smart home.
